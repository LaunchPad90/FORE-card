# Welcome to FORE!-card!

<p>Created with Express, Mongoose, and React</p>


<p>In this app I wanted to make an easily accesible, and mobile version of your scorecard. Keeping track of your scores and places you've played in recent rounds.</p>

My data models, starting out basic but in future versions would love to expand on an api with more detailed information. Maybe even create an api, since there are no public golf course api's that i could find.
